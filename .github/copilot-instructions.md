# Copilot Instructions for ztp-website

## Project Status
This is a brand-new website project in its initial setup phase. As the codebase grows, these instructions will evolve to document established patterns and workflows.

## Current Scope
**Repository**: Website code for the ztp project  
**Type**: Web application (architecture TBD)

## Getting Started for AI Agents

When assisting with this project:

1. **Repository State**: This is a minimal repository - expect sparse codebase initially
2. **Expected Technology Stack**: Monitor commits for:
   - Frontend framework (Next.js, React, Vue, etc.)
   - Styling approach (Tailwind, CSS modules, etc.)
   - Build tools and package manager
   - Development workflow tooling

3. **Conventions to Establish**:
   - Component structure and naming
   - File organization (src/, components/, pages/, etc.)
   - Environment configuration patterns
   - Testing approach (if applicable)
   - Git workflow (branching strategy, commit conventions)

## When Code Arrives

As the project develops, AI agents should:
- Extract patterns from the first few commits to understand architectural decisions
- Identify key directories and their responsibilities
- Note any build scripts or development commands in package.json or Makefile
- Document external integrations and service boundaries
- Follow existing file naming and organization conventions

## Quick Reference
- **Main Branch**: `main` (primary development branch)
- **Remote**: `origin` points to gozdur/ztp-website
- **README**: Currently minimal - will expand as project develops
